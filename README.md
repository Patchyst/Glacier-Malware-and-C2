## motivations for this project
I wanted to get a better understanding of basic malware development techniques such as, obfuscation, persistence, and data exfiltration. I also wanted to get a basic understanding of how C2 servers are structured, hence the custom C2. Any suggestions on improvements or future projects are greatly appreciated!

# Win32 Agent functionality
* Communicates via HTTP using a custom symmetric encryption for obfuscation
* navigate the a victim's file system using a custom dir implementation
* view file contents
* download files from infected windows device
* upload files to infected windows device
* execute files on infected windows device
* download saved network names/security information, including passwords

## Anti-analysis techniques
### Static
* suspicious functions for editing the registry and executing malicious files are hidden from the IAT by dynamically resolving the function addresses at runtime
* suspicious strings are obfuscated at compile time and decrypted at runtime

### Dynamic
* Basic hardware checks on processor count and RAM are used to detect if the agent may be running in a sanbox/VM
